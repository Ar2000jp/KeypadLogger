KeypadLogger is a small Arduino program that logs key presses on a keypad to an
    SD card with time-stamps.

A file (time.txt) is used to set the RTCs time. This file is deleted after
    being used. The file format is: 2014 12 30 23 59 59

The key presses are logged using the system's time (millis() - startTime).
    A time-stamp from the RTC is appended to the start of the file
    for reference.
